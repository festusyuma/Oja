  <p>
    OJA is an E-commerce company, offering a third-party
    online market platform for supermarkets and
    restaurants to provide their products and services
    to consumers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    OJA offers a solution to the widespread issue of poor accessibility to
    food and resources demanded by university students, primarily in
    Nigeria. 
  </p>

<p>
    As a solution to this problem, OJA connects customers to
    supermarkets and restaurants in close proximity, via a third party app
    that provides an efficient ordering service at minimal cost to both
    parties involved (University students and Restaurants/Supermarkets).
  </p>

  <p>
    The OJA app will be launched in Babcock University, a viable market
    that offers immense growth opportunities for both OJA and users of
    the app. After a successful launch and understudy of the market
    through monitoring feedback and responsiveness of the app, 
    the E-commerce platform will be made available to other institutions
    nationwide, with tailored services offered to each institution
    depending on specific consumer demand from the market.
